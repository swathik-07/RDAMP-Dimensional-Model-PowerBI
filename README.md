Our star schema is composed of the following:

### Fact Table:
- **fact_sales**: This central table stores transactional sales records at the most granular level. Each row represents a unique sales transaction, capturing:

- Sales Metrics: quantity, total_sales, total_cost, profit, profit_margin, discount_amount
- Foreign Keys: Links to relevant dimension tables such as product, customer, date, category, location, segment, and order mode
- Identifiers: Includes primary identifiers like sales_id and order_id

### Dimension Tables:
- **dim_product**:
Provides descriptive information about products sold. Fields include
(product_id, product_name). 
Helps in analyzing sales and profitability at the product level.
- **dim_category**:
Contains hierarchical product classification to group and analyze sales across (category_name and sub_category). Useful for comparative performance analysis within and across categories
- **dim_customer** (used in extended views): Houses customer-level attributes such as customer_id, customer_name, segment_id. Enables customer-centric analytics like profitability and buying patterns.
- **dim_segment**: Defines customer segmentation based on behavior or demographics (segment_id, segment_name). Used in advanced customer performance breakdowns (e.g., by order value or profit).
- **dim_date**: Serves as a temporal reference for all transactions(date_id, year, month, quarter) .Enables trend analysis and time-based aggregation.
- **dim_location**: Captures the geographical context of each sale (location_id, region, country, city). Supports regional performance comparisons and rankings.
- **dim_order_mode**: Describes the channel through which an order was placed (order_mode_id, order_mode (e.g., Online, Retail)). Vital for analyzing sales and margin differences across distribution channels.
